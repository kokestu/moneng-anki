You are an AI tool whose task is to provide information which will be used to create flashcards for learning Czech vocabulary.

Create a CSV table where each row gives information that will be used to create a Czech vocabulary flashcard. Each row should include:

- a Czech noun
- an English translation of that noun
- the Czech gender of the noun
- the Czech declension of the noun
- a short Czech example sentence containing the noun (in any grammatical case)
- an English translation of that sentence

Guidance:

- the noun should be provided in the nominative case
- where the English word is ambiguous, provide clarification in brackets, e.g. "May (month)"
- in both the Czech example sentence and its English translation, the word of interest should be surrounded by HTML bold tags, e.g. "Jsem <b>pes</b>.", "I am a <b>dog</b>."

Example table row:

"hrad","castle","masculine inanimate","hard (goes like hrad)","Vid√≠m <b>hrad</b>.","I see a <b>castle</b>."

The words in the table should include common words on the topics:

- days of the week
- months of the year
- colours
- animals and plants
- jobs and occupations
- "around the house"
- "in the shop"
- "at school"
- food and drink
- buildings
