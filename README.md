# moneng-anki
A project that contains various scripts for building Anki decks on things that interest me.

- scrape Wikidata and build an Anki deck of kings and queens of England.
- scraping of Wiktionary for building flashcards of phrases containing common Czech words (`czech/` subdirectory).

## Installation

Depends on the `genanki` package:
